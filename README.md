## My notes on Time Series Analysis
---

Recently I started an online course on [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) related to Time Series analysis with Python titled [ARIMA models in Python](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/arima-models-in-python). Since I tend to forget tools I don't regularly use, I thought of documenting the techniques used in the course. We went over **ARIMA**-related time-series analysis tools and implemented them using [python](https://www.python.org/)'s [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) package. This was my first exposure with `statsmodels` but it seems to be a friendly module to analyze statistical models. Typically I had been doing this in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) but since I enjoy python more, `statsmodels` might be the way going forward. 

In any case, in [this](time_series_analysis_notes.ipynb) notebook I analyze the ARIMA tools learnt in the online course with my dataset.
